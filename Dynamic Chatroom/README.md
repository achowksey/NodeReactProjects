Creative Portion:

Host Transfer: By selecting another user in the chatroom and clicking the 'Make Host' button, the current host transfers all creator privileges to the selected user. Since there can only be one host per room, the previous host no longer retains those capabilities and is regulated to a normal chatroom user.

Destroy Room: By clicking the 'Destroy Room' button, the host destroys the chatroom. All users currently in the chatroom (including the host) are kicked back to the dashboard view and a popup window appears on their screens alerting them that the room has been destroyed. The destroyed room is removed from the dashboard view and cannot be joined/restored.

Clear Board: Each user is given the option to clear their chatboard. By pressing "Clear" in the chatroom view, the user clears their messaging board but doesn't erase the chatboard of any other users.

Dashboard Chatroom: After logging in, each user is taken to a dashboard view which includes a communal chatroom. This chatroom is used for communication between everyone currently logged into the site, regardless of which room they're in. Additionally, all the current users of the site are displayed above the chatroom, under "All Users." This chatboard also serves as an activity log, tracking when a user creates/leaves a room, when a user is kicked/banned from a room, when a user becomes the new host of a room, and when a room is destroyed. We chose to not include the private messaging and clear board functionalities in this chatroom as we felt that would defeat the purpose of having a communcal chatroom for everyone to openly communicate.
