**Description of Creative Portion**
- Settings: Created a settings page where users can update their personal information. This includes inputting a new age, new weight, new target weight, new height, and new activity level. In addition, users can also update their account's password. Finally, users can also delete their account, which will erase all their personal custom foods, their food entries, their posts, their information, etc.
- Posts: Created a posts page where users can send posts to all users on the platform and manage/delete their previous posts. The view posts page will only display posts from that specific day in order to increase the posts's relevancy and minimize clutter. However, users do have access to their previous posts if they want to view them.
- Custom Meals: Created a manage custom meals page where users can view, update, delete, and share their custom meals. After picking which meal to edit, all the information about that meal is preloaded so customers can edit only the specific details they want while retaining all previous information. They can also edit multiple fields at a time if they want. Users can also delete these meals, but if they've previously logged these fields in past food entries, the information will still be available. Finally, users can also share their custom meals with other valid users. If a user deletes their custom meal, it will not delete the meal for the shared users. 
- Progress: In addition to the functionality outlined in the rubric, we added additional features to the progress page. First, we calculated the user's Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), how many pounds the user needs to lose to reach their target weight, and how many days it would take for them to do so based on our target calories. We displayed all this information for the user. Finally, we found many motivational fitness quotes, of which one is randomly assigned for display on the page
